# RISC-V tinkering with Bluespec

I like RISC-V! I also like HDLs that are more productive than Verilog!

The "official" RISC-V implementations in Bluespec are ... very elaborate and
difficult to understand. So, in a quest for better understanding, I've written
my own.

- `Corny5` is a fairly literal gloss of the RV32I spec, explicitly optimized for
  clarity rather than speed or area. It is reasonably speedy but huge. 2 cycles
  per instruction (CPI).
- `Dinky5` is explicitly optimized for area and resources. In particular, it
  uses half the iCE40 BRAMs of the other designs. 3-4 CPI.
- `Tangy5` is intended to be optimized for speed, but to be honest I got kind of
  bored with it. 2 CPI.
- `Twisty5` is a four-thread barrel processor offering roughly four times the
  throughput of the other cores in about the same area. 4-8 CPI in terms of the
  system clock.

This is currently intended as an experiment and educational resource, and I make
no arguments about this being the bestest RISC-V ever (or even that it is
correct).

# Sizes and stats

This is mostly for my reference, when I return to this project later wondering
about the results. Numbers may be out of date.
